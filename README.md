# Hi, Iâ€™m A.H. Faria

I build prompts that think like people do: flexible, structured, and grounded in real use. My focus is on content and metadata, not just what something says, but how itâ€™s shaped, sorted, and surfaced to actually help.

This work is about thinking in systems, using language and structure to make complex tasks easier to approach. Whether it is refining a job search, outlining a writing project, or improving the flow of a task, each prompt I build is meant to respond to how people actually think and work, not how a system assumes they should.

My prompts are modular and branching, with clear entry points, logic driven paths, and the freedom to skip ahead, backtrack, or pause for snacks, similar to a choose your own adventure book. They are built to help people figure out what works best for their needs and choices...without the untimely demise a wrong chapter may bring.
