#  ✨Hi, I’m A.H. Faria

I care deeply about how information is created, maintained, and shared, because people make real decisions based on what they find, whether it's as simple as where to eat or as important as what doctor to visit. It's why I believe organizations have a responsibility to ensure their information is reliable, unbiased, and accurate.

I focus on data and information governance, metadata management, and information integrity, helping organizations prevent downstream failures caused by inconsistent definitions, poor classification, and unvetted data.

I apply these same principles directly to AI where accurate, ethical, and well-structured information is the key to a strong foundation.

## 🖥️Audit Strategies


Information integrity work and AI output evaluation share the same core failure modes: inaccurate records, inconsistent classifications, missing context, outdated information, and outputs that can have a negative impact on the people relying on them.

I apply a structured audit approach to identify and address gaps that cause downstream issues.

ℹ️ Information & Data Integrity

- Accuracy
- Classification consistency
- Definition and standards alignment
- Information lifecycle validity
- Source reliability

💻 AI Output Evaluation

- Bias and fairness
- Cognitive accessibility
- Misaligned or unintended outputs
- Response integrity
- UX clarity

This approach supports organizations working through process improvement, content workflow challenges, classification gaps, and responsible AI integration, whether the problem lives in a legacy database, a vendor submission, or a generated output.
