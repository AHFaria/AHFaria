#  ✨Hi, I’m A.H. Faria

My background spans metadata QA, classification, and content analysis.  These skills support research, data governance, and workflow development across publishing, legal, and corporate content environments. I bring this experience into my prompt design work, creating AI-assisted systems that bring clarity and structure to complex workflows. With a foundation in real-world use, I develop prompt frameworks that balance precision, accessibility, and adaptability.

My approach is grounded in transferable logic and modular design. I create systems that can be adapted for job search workflows, ethical evaluations, executive function support, and structured communication. 



## 🖥️Audit Strategies


To support this, I apply a range of audit strategies, including adversarial testing (red teaming), to stress test for:

- Bias
- Cognitive accessibility
- Ethical resilience under pressure
- Functional accuracy
- Misaligned behavior
- Unintended outputs
- UX clarity


The core structures of these projects are built to handle layered decision making, shifting priorities, and cognitive strain—whether that means surfacing metadata tags from vague job titles, guiding users through ethical judgment calls, or adapting logic to fit varied user needs. I aim to build systems that reduce overwhelm, adapt to context, and support thoughtful, responsible use of AI. This perspective also supports process improvement, documentation clarity, user-centered design, and structured content workflows across a range of domains.
